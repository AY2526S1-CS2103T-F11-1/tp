Are you an independent doctor looking for a simple yet powerful way to manage patient information? Do you find existing
clinic management systems too complex or cumbersome for your daily needs? Or perhaps you just want a lightweight, privacy-focused tool that keeps your patients’ records right at your fingertips?

**HealthNote** is your all-in-one, command-line solution for seamless patient management — designed specifically for 
doctors who value speed, control, and simplicity.

With **HealthNote**, you can easily:
- **Add** new patients and record key details such as contact information, medical history, and allergies
- **View** a patient’s medical information in seconds
- **Find** patients by name or specific keywords
- **Delete** outdated records when necessary
- …and do much more — all directly from your terminal!

Built with independent practitioners and small clinics in mind, **HealthNote** keeps your workflow efficient and 
focused. Whether you’re managing a handful of patients or maintaining a growing list, this CLI-based address book gives 
you the precision and speed you need — without unnecessary clutter.

**HealthNote** is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface (CLI) while still having 
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HealthNote can get your patient management tasks 
done faster than traditional GUI apps.
