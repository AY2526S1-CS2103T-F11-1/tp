## Introduction

Are you an independent doctor looking for a simple yet powerful way to manage patient information? Do you find existing clinic management systems too complex or cumbersome for your daily needs? Or perhaps you just want a lightweight, privacy-focused tool that keeps your patients’ records right at your fingertips?

**HealthNote** is your all-in-one, command-line solution for seamless patient management — designed specifically for doctors who value speed, control, and simplicity.

With **HealthNote**, you can easily:
- **Add** new patients and record key details such as contact information, medical history, and allergies
- **View** a patient’s medical information in seconds
- **Find** patients by name or specific keywords
- **Delete** outdated records when necessary
- …and do much more — all directly from your terminal!

Built with independent practitioners and small clinics in mind, **HealthNote** keeps your workflow efficient and focused. Whether you’re managing a handful of patients or maintaining a growing list, this CLI-based address book gives you the precision and speed you need — without unnecessary clutter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HealthNote.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\friend` or as `n\John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\friend`, `t\friend t\family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Feature - Data Management

### Saving the data

HealthNote data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HealthNote data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HealthNote will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HealthNote to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HealthNote home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will be focused, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
